the state diagram as well as the specification (narration) of Gishushu Traffic LightsHere are some specifications for the traffic light control system based on the diagram:

Specifications for Traffic Light Control System

1. **Traffic Light States**:
   - **Green Light Duration**: 
     - East-West Light: 30 seconds
     - North-South Light: 30 seconds
     - East-South Light: 25 seconds
     - West-East Light: 25 seconds
     - South-North Light: 25 seconds
     - South-East Light: 25 seconds
   - **Yellow Light Duration**: 
     - All directions: 5 seconds
   - **Red Light Duration**: 
     - Maintains state until the timer for the next light turns Green.

2. **Timer Specifications**:
   - **Timer Accuracy**: Â±1 second
   - **Manual Override**: Ability to manually control lights in emergencies.

3. **Interlocking Mechanism**:
   - The system ensures that no two opposing directions have a Green light simultaneously.
   - Transition from Green to Yellow must be followed by a complete Red phase for the opposing direction before it turns Green.

4. **Communication Between Lights**:
   - Each light maintains communication paths to signal the change of states upon timer expiration.
   - Signal acknowledgment to ensure that changes are recognized system-wide.

5. **Emergency Vehicle Priority**:
   - The system includes an emergency vehicle detection feature, allowing it to change relevant lights to Green when an emergency vehicle is approaching.

6. **Pedestrian Crossing Features**:
   - Pedestrian signals integrated to coincide with the traffic light changes.
   - Countdown timers for pedestrians to indicate how long they have to cross.

7. **Power Supply and Backup**:
   - **Primary Power**: Main electrical supply for normal operation.
   - **Backup Battery**: Rechargeable battery for operation during power outages.

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**:
   - Real-time monitoring system for traffic patterns and light malfunctions.
   - Scheduled maintenance checks every six months to assess the functionality and replace any faulty components.

9. **System Scalability**:
   - The system can be integrated with additional traffic lights and sensors as needed without significant reconfiguration.

10. **Software and Control System**:
    - Programmable logic controller (PLC) for all traffic light functions.
    - User interface for city traffic management to adjust timings and monitor traffic congestion.

These specifications ensure the safe and efficient operation of the traffic light control system at intersection points, accommodating both vehicular and pedestrian traffic while maintaining coordination across different directions.
